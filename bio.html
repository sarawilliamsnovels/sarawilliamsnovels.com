<center><h2>About Sara</h2><br/></center>

Sara Williams is the author of four novels set in the beloved haunts of her travels.

<p>Her most recent, <b><i>Millie McCall's Full Moon Poker Night</i></b>, a novella and short story collection, is set in the San Juan Islands of Washington State. Her suspense novels include <i><b>One Big Itch</i></b>, set in Hawaii, <i><b> The Serenoa Scandal </i></b> is set in Floridaâ€™s Okeechobee ranch country, and the <i><b>The Don Juan Con
</i></b>, a cross-country chase from Southwest Florida to the San Juan Islands. Sara's novels have been well-received in the literary world. The Don Juan Con was optioned in Hollywood by Robert Evans Paramount. The Serenoa Scandal was a subject of a PBS/Florida magazine and radio feature. One Big Itch was a featured selection of the Miami Book Fair International.</p>

<p>Ms. Williams was born in Deer Park, Washington just north of Spokane. She attended The George Washington University in Washington D.C. and earned her B.A. degree in English literature at the University of Washington. Sara was inspired to write when working for a U.S. Senator in D.C. and taking a class in American Studies when she located a Walt Whitman document in the Library of Congress that many scholars had thought to be lost. This experience taught Sara a valuable lesson: Since a writer's works are shelved in the world's most formidable library, the work should be worthy of the self space.</p>

<p>After graduation, Sara became associate editor of Cascades Magazine, a well-known Pacific Northwest industrial magazine, then became a P.R. Director of the Washington Dairy Commission. She met her current husband Bill at a regional advertising convention at Rosario Resort on Orcas Island in the American San Juans. They undertook a sailing trip to Hawaii and loved it so much they stayed on for eight years. Their two sons were born in Hawaii, where the couple owned a business and Sara had a real estate brokerage.  They settled in Fort Myers Florida in the early 80s, where Sara became a staff writer and columnist for the News Press of Fort Myers.</p>
	
<p>The Williamses now divide their time between a winter home in Fort Myers and a summer residence on Orcas Island, while making frequent visits to Hawaii. They also spend considerable time at LTU Villas a family-owned resort in Negril, Jamaica. Their sailing expeditions from the east coast include Isla Mujeres in the Gulf of Mexico, the Rio Dulce in Guatemala and the Honduran gulf coast, where they toured various ruins with archeologists working for <i>National Geographic Magazine</i>, and spent time among the <i>Garifone</i> people of Honduras.</p>

<p>A member of Mystery Writers of America, Sara has appeared as a speaker at the Sleuthfest, Bouchercon conventions, and the Maui Writers Conference. Sara attended The George Washington University in Washington D.C. and earned her B.A. degree in English literature at the University of Washington, Seattle. Sara was an associate editor of Cascades Magazine, Seattle, and later a staff writer/columnist for the Fort Myers, Florida News-Press, where many of her pieces were syndicated nationally via the Gannett Wire.</p>

<p>Sara and her husband Bill were blue water sailors. They sailed from The San Juan Islands to Hawaii via Southern California and lingered on Maui for a decade. Their east-coast sailing expeditions include Isla Mujeres off the Yucatan Peninsula, the Rio Dulce river in Guatemala and the Honduran gulf coast. The Williams currently divide their time between Orcas Island in the San Juans and Fort Myers, Florida.</p>
